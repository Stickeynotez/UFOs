# UFO Sighting Web Page

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to pair and execute JavaScript functions with HTML and CSS to create a stunning new webpage with an easy to read and filter table for UFO sightings.

## Results

To preface, this page was created to compile UFO sighting data. This is shown in the header area of the web page

A user has two ways of using this web page dataset.
1.) Scroll through the entire dataset manually 
2.) Use the ease of access filters on the left side of the table to narrow the search down by just one parameter or multiple parameters. Shown in the image below.

# Filtered Table Example
By entering a new date, we can see the filtered table.
The same can be done with city, state, country, or shape of the UFO.

# Summary
Overall, the design of this webpage is extremely simple, yet effective for its intended use. The primary drawback with this webpage however, is the data attached to it. The dataset has built in ambiguity, also, the City, the States abbreviations and Country abbreviation are lower case. The Duration is not a consistent format of time (varying from 5 mins. to 13'Minutes' to "downtown")

These data entries are from everyday forum users, causing the lack of clean data. 
One recommendation to make this webpage better would be to clean the data ourselves.
Another recommendation would be to make the filtering options available without direct user input, as the user will know know the way the data is written.
